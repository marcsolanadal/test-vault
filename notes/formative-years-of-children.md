> [!note] Generated by ChatGPT
> Only corrected the age range based on the article.

The **formative years of children** typically refer to the early stages of childhood, particularly from infancy **to around the age of eight**. During this period, children undergo significant physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and they are particularly susceptible to influence and learning from their environment, including their parents or primary caregivers. The experiences and interactions during these formative years can have a lasting impact on a child's development and shape their future behaviors, attitudes, and habits.
