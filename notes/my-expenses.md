# MY EXPENSES

---

I want to have a list with all my current expenses with a projection of the cost for 10 years. This allows me to see if the cost is acceptable in the long term.

It's much better to use a spreadsheet instead of a Markdown table (See [[tools-need-to-fit-together]]). I'll use Google Sheets since It can be opened in a web browser.
