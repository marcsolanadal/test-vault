# HABITS PROPAGATE FROM PARENTS TO THEIR CHILDREN

---

Parents raising their children unconsciously transfer their habits. Children take their parents as role models, and if they see them doing something, they will imitate them since they don't know what is good or bad at a young age. This instills the parents' habits in their brain from a young age.

As an example, we can see how Biel and Judit inherit their parents' habits. Since their parents have some really toxic habits, those are passed down to them. For instance, being childish, crying for attention, etcâ€¦

I wonder what habits I inherited from my parents. A clear one is the passion for [hicking]({{< ref "hicking" >}}) from my father, and the desire to be loved from my mother.

This is common knowledge in child psychology (Take a look at the [formative-years-of-children]({{< ref "formative-years-of-children" >}}) for more information).
